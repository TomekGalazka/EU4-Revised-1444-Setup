  MEE_Byzantine_Events.60.desc:0 "With the reconquest of the ancient Carthaginian coast, the Byzantine banners once again fly over the lands of Africa. Memories of Justinian’s grand ambitions resurface, as ruling these distant territories directly from Constantinople would be an arduous task. The idea of re-establishing the Exarchate, a semi-autonomous military and administrative governorship, has been proposed. The city of Tunis, now renamed Tunida, stands as the ideal capital for this endeavor, serving as both a bastion of imperial rule and a shield against future incursions. Shall we embrace this ancient tradition and appoint an Exarch to rule in our name?"

  MEE_Byzantine_Events.61.t:0 "Exarchate of Ravenna"
  MEE_Byzantine_Events.61.desc:0 "With Italy once again under the dominion of the Byzantine Empire, the question of governance arises. Direct rule from Constantinople over these far-flung provinces is proving inefficient, as the Western territories require strong military oversight against both internal dissent and foreign threats. Some advisors suggest restoring the Exarchate of Ravenna, a semi-autonomous governorship that once safeguarded imperial rule in Italy. Establishing an Exarch in Ravenna would ensure swift military response and efficient administration, but it would also grant a degree of local autonomy. Shall we revive this institution to secure our hold over Italy?"
  MEE_Byzantine_Events.61.a:0 "Restore the Exarchate of Ravenna!"
  MEE_Byzantine_Events.61.b:0 "No need for intermediaries, rule Italy directly!"
  
  MEE_Byzantine_Events.62.t:0 "Hellenization of Italy"
  MEE_Byzantine_Events.62.d:0 "Restoration of the Exarchate of Ravenna has drawn waves of Greek settlers, officials, and soldiers to Italy, bringing their language, traditions, and Orthodox faith. At the same time, many Latin locals, drawn to the power and prestige of Constantinople, have begun to adopt Greek customs, merging their heritage with the new rulers. Over time, this fusion has given birth to a distinct Italo-Greek identity—the Griko. Hellenized cities now dot the Italian landscape, and the Orthodox Church grows in influence."
