 flavor_arm.5.d: "After centuries of foreign rule and decay, the ancient city of Ani - once the dazzling capital of the Armenian Bagratid Kingdom—has finally returned to Armenian hands. The wind now whispers through ruined basilicas and fallen ramparts, not with sorrow, but with promise. Determined to restore its former glory, Armenian architects, merchants, and pilgrims pour into the city, rebuilding its walls, sanctuaries, and markets stone by stone. Under Armenian rule, Ani blossoms once more. Its strategic position along the Silk Road transforms it into a thriving hub of commerce, culture, and faith. Caravans bearing spices from India, silks from China, and glass from Venice converge in its bustling bazaars. As the city rises, so too does the Armenian spirit, rekindling a golden age thought long lost. With Ani restored, it is only fitting that the seat of power be brought home. The capital is moved to Ani, signaling to the world that Armenia is not only reborn—but rising."
